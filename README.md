coherence-bootstrap
===================

Set of working code snippets designed for getting started with Coherence along with some more advanced tips and tricks.
The tests and examples are supported by a multi-process test suite which was a precursor to the little-grid work done
in the coherence incubator*.

**Basics:**
* Aggregators
* Cache Stores (Async/Sync)
* CQCs
* Entry Processors
* Extend Proxies
* Index Performance
* MapListeners
* Near Caching
* PartitionListeners (for detecting data loss)
* POF
* Put & Get
* Triggers

**More Complex**
* Hopping between caches on the server
* How listeners can lose data
* Membership listeners
* Multithreaded clients
* PutAll that reports individual errors
* Overflow caches
* Using services to isolate work onto groups of hardware
